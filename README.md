## What is Kairos?

Kairos is a **lightweight, privacy-first screen time tracker** for Windows, macOS, and Linux that runs silently in your system tray and tells you exactly where your attention went throughout the day — broken down by app, website, and category.

Unlike cloud-based alternatives, **all data stays on your machine** in a local SQLite database. There are no subscriptions, no accounts, and no telemetry. Kairos also goes beyond simple time tracking by integrating a **Pomodoro timer**, **ambient focus sounds**, a **to-do list**, and a **live electricity usage monitor** so you can see the environmental and financial cost of your screen time.

---

### 🔔 Smart App Categorisation
> When Kairos detects an unknown application for the first time, it asks you to categorise it. Your choice is saved permanently and applied to all future sessions.

### ⚡ Electricity Usage
> Live system power draw updated every 10 seconds. Kairos automatically picks the most accurate source — battery telemetry on laptops, NVML/ADL sensor on desktops — and shows cumulative kWh consumed today.

---

### 🍅 Pomodoro Timer
> A clean circular countdown with automatic focus → short break → long break cycling. Today's completed sessions and total focus time are tracked automatically.

---

### 🎵 Focus Sounds
> Three layered ambient soundscapes — **Pluvia** (rain), **Silva** (forest), **Focus Static** (white noise) — each with independent volume control and a live canvas audio visualiser.

---

### ✅ To-Do List
> Keep your day organized with a built-in task list for quick reminders, follow-ups, and focus goals — all stored locally alongside your screen time data.

### 🎨 Themes
> Switch instantly between 7 hand-crafted themes. Your selection persists across restarts.

## 🏗️ Architecture

Kairos is a **Tauri 2** application: a Rust backend exposed to a Vanilla JS frontend over a zero-overhead IPC bridge. Everything runs as a single native binary with an embedded WebView — no Electron, no Node.js runtime.

### Key Design Decisions

- **Session flushing every ≥5 s** — the tracker thread writes `UPDATE sessions SET end_time = now` on every tick for the current session. This means category changes made mid-session take effect immediately in charts, with no stale data.
- **YouTube intelligence** — browser sessions containing YouTube are further classified by title keywords. Educational content (`tutorial`, `lecture`, `coding`, …) → `Productive`; entertainment (`shorts`, `gameplay`, `trailer`, …) → `Distracting`; ambiguous content after 2 minutes → flagged for review.
- **Power source hierarchy** — battery discharge rate (laptop) → NVML (NVIDIA GPU) → ADL2 (AMD GPU, `atiadlxx.dll`) → LibreHardwareMonitor WMI → WMI GPU engine utilisation → CPU % × TDP estimate + 30 W base draw. The smoothing ring buffer prevents spikes from misleading averages.
- **Close-to-tray** — the `CloseRequested` window event is intercepted; the window hides rather than quits, so tracking is never interrupted by accidentally closing the window.

### Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|---|---|
| App framework | [Tauri 2](https://tauri.app) |
| Backend language | Rust (edition 2021) |
| Database | SQLite via `rusqlite` (bundled, no install needed) |
| Window detection | `active-win-pos-rs` |
| System info | `sysinfo` |
| Battery | `battery` |
| NVIDIA GPU | `nvml-wrapper` |
| AMD GPU | `libloading` (ADL2 / `atiadlxx.dll`), `wmi` |
| Async runtime | `tokio` |
| Frontend charting | [Chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org) |
| Fonts | [Cinzel](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Cinzel) + [Inter](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Inter) |

## ⚙️ Installation

### Option 1 — Download the Installer (Recommended)

Go to the [**Releases**](https://github.com/osklc/kairos/releases/latest) page and download the installer for your platform:

#### 🪟 Windows
1. Download `Kairos_x.x.x_x64_en-US.msi` (or the `.exe` setup).
2. Run the installer.
> **Note on Windows Security:** Since this is an independent open-source project and not digitally signed with a paid certificate, Windows SmartScreen may show a warning. You can proceed by clicking **More info** and **Run anyway**. The code is fully open‑source for your audit.
3. Kairos starts tracking immediately and appears in your system tray.

#### 🍎 macOS
1. Download `Kairos_x.x.x_aarch64.dmg` (for Apple Silicon / M1/M2/M3) or `Kairos_x.x.x_x64.dmg` (for Intel).
2. Open the `.dmg` file and drag **Kairos** to your **Applications** folder.
3. On first launch, right-click (or Control-click) **Kairos** and select **Open** to bypass the macOS "unidentified developer" warning.

#### 🐧 Ubuntu / Linux
* **DEB Package (Recommended):**
  1. Download `kairos_x.x.x_amd64.deb`.
  2. Install it using your package manager or terminal:
     ```bash
     sudo dpkg -i kairos_*.deb
     # Or: sudo apt install ./kairos_*.deb
     ```
* **AppImage:**
  1. Download `Kairos_x.x.x_amd64.AppImage`.
  2. Make it executable and run:
     ```bash
     chmod +x Kairos_*.AppImage
     ./Kairos_*.AppImage
     ```

> [**⬇ Download: Windows | macOS | Ubuntu**](https://github.com/osklc/kairos/releases/latest)

### Option 2 — Build from Source

#### Prerequisites

| Tool | Version | Install |
|---|---|---|
| Rust | ≥ 1.78 | [rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs) |
| Node.js | ≥ 18 | [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org) |
| WebView2 | latest | Pre-installed on Windows 11; [download for Win 10](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/webview2/) |

#### Steps

```powershell
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/osklc/kairos.git
cd kairos

# 2. Install Tauri CLI
npm install

# 3. Run in development mode (hot-reload)
npm run tauri dev

# 4. Build a production installer
npm run tauri build
# Output: src-tauri/target/release/bundle/nsis/Kairos_x.x.x_x64-setup.exe
```

> **Note:** On first build, Cargo will compile ~200 crates which may take 5–10 minutes. Subsequent builds are incremental.

#### AMD GPU Power Reading (optional)

Kairos reads AMD GPU power via the **ADL2** interface (`atiadlxx.dll`), which ships with AMD Radeon Software. If you do not have Radeon Software installed, Kairos automatically falls back to WMI-based GPU utilisation estimation — no manual configuration needed.

## 🛠️ Configuration

All settings are stored in the application's data directory:

```
%APPDATA%\com.osklc.kairos\
  tracker.db       ← SQLite database (sessions, categories, settings)
```

You can manage everything from the **Settings** page inside the app:

| Setting | Description |
|---|---|
| **Theme** | Choose from 7 built-in themes |
| **Language** | English / Turkish |
| **Launch on Startup** | Register Kairos with Windows autostart via `tauri-plugin-autostart` |
| **Disable category prompts** | Suppress the "New App Detected" modal |
| **Categorise Apps** | Manually override the category of any tracked application |
